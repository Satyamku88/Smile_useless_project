# ​ Smile Snap (Smile Useless Project)

**Smile Snap** is the most delightful nonsense you'll ever install—a smile-scoring app that tracks your daily grins, generates goofy certificates, and lets you challenge friends to beat your best *smile score*.

---

##  Features

- **AI-Powered Smile Scoring** — Uses face detection (if available), otherwise resorts to delightfully arbitrary randomness.
- **Silly Filters** — Add sparkles, rainbows, sunglasses, or moustaches to your smile shot.
- **Pre-Score Useless Form** — Answer questions like:
  - "How many ducks have you smiled at today?"  
  - "Rate your teeth: 1 = rice grain, 10 = Great Wall of China."
- **Challenge Friends** — Send your smile score and dare friends to out-grin you.
- **Smile Streak Tracker** — Logs consecutive smile days; tracked visually like GitHub contributions.
- **Leaderboard of Weirdness** — Daily rankings for oddest or brightest smiles.
- **Monthly & Daily Certificates** — Auto-generate shareable certificates with personalized, absurd greetings.
- **Dashboard Calendar** — GitHub-style grid showing your daily smile intensity via image clicks.
- **Social Sharing** — Export your certificates, leaderboard status, or streak graphic to WhatsApp, Instagram, or elsewhere.
- **Local Data & CSV Export** — Everything's stored in browser storage; export optionally for no real reason.

##  Why This Exists

This isn’t about utility—it’s about joy, humor, and turning something as simple as a smile into a playful competition with friends. It’s a reminder that fun can be meaningless... and that’s okay.
